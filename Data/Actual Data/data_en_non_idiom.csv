1944,ghost town,Part of the reason Ghost Town is able to offer beer at such prices is because it maintains tight control over production and distribution.,"It does all its own brewing and all its own delivery, which is no small feat considering production has nearly doubled since Nosh first wrote about Ghost Town in 2018.","It now sells its beers as far north as Windsor in Sonoma County, as far south as San Jose, and east to Sacramento."

2004,civil marriage,"The move is monumental for Israel, which does not permit civil marriages within the country.","In the past, couples who did not want or could not be married in a religious ceremony, such as those who are LGBTQ, interfaith or nonreligious couples, have had to travel outside of the country to be married civilly before bringing back their civil marriage license to register with Israeli officials.","The pandemic, of course, severely limited couples’ ability to travel outside of Israel for such marriages."

2580,field work,"Joshua Weiner writes: ""While the move south seemed to some a deliberate withdrawal from a previous political commitment to fight the British presence in Ireland, Field Work indicates rather a growing commitment to stay engaged, but to do so by maintaining the long view, which asks questions more than it assumes positions.""","In a 1981 interview with Frank Kinahan, Heaney said Field Work ""was an attempt to try to do something deliberately: to change the note and to lengthen the line, and to bring elements of my social self, elements of my usual nature, which is more convivial than most of the poems before that might suggest, to try to bring all that into play.",Dr. Rand Brandes tells the story of the title Field Work in The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney.
2581,field work,"Of course, because he is Seamus Heaney, the hard work pays off","Field Work is a beautiful book of verse composed by the Nobel laureate at the pinnacle of his poetic career, inspired by the four years he spent in County Wicklow, a rural area south of Dublin, far from the incessant violence of Belfast, the poet’s home.","The first third of Field Work is marked by poignant elegies to friends murdered during the Troubles, the wondrous Glanmore Sonnets constitute the middle third, and the final third features a series of deeply personal lyrics rooted in Wicklow’s rich soil."
2582,field work,"For me, as an Irishman living abroad, I like to read Heaney on my return.",Field Work brought me back to my roots-my childhood and a stimulating new adult experience- and he surely has an especial charm for the Hibernian. ,"Yet, this work and others alike from the Nobel Laureate, deepen particularities and transcend them in a non-zero sum game."
2583,field work,"At one point, Heaney asks, “What is my apology for poetry?” For this reader, he need not defend his “trade,” to use Yeats’s term, whatsoever.","In 1979, just after Field Work was published, Denis Donoghue of the New York Times wrote that “what is exhilarating in these poems [that is, the poems of Field Work] is the relation between their two musics: the music of what happens comes first, and Heaney listens to it, receives it as a gift, like the first line of a poem; the second music is what he makes of the first, taking it into himself and finding a voice for it there.”",I have yet to find a better characterization of Heaney’s poetry in this collection.
